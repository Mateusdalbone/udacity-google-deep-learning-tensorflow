# Google's Deep Learning Course on Udacity

[Google's deep learning course on Udacity](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity), which was taught by [Vincent Vanhoucke](http://research.google.com/pubs/VincentVanhoucke.html), Principal Scientist at Google, is really great! This repo is to collect my solutions to the corresponding assignments and quizzes.
